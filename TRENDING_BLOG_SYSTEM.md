# Automated Trending Blog Post Generation System

## Overview

This system automatically generates blog posts by analyzing current web development trends and transforming them into business-focused content for Berlin-based companies. It combines live trend data with AI content generation to create relevant, timely blog posts without manual topic specification.

## How It Works

### 1. **Dynamic Trend Sources**
- **GitHub Trending**: Fetches trending repositories related to web development, JavaScript, TypeScript, React, Vue, Angular, and Next.js
- **Dev.to API**: Pulls popular articles from the web development community with high engagement
- **Curated Berlin Business Trends**: Local market focus including GDPR compliance, multi-language support, and German payment integrations
- **Seasonal Trends**: Contextual topics based on current time of year (Q4 holiday optimization, Q1 redesigns, etc.)

### 2. **Topic Generation Process**
The system transforms raw trends into actionable business topics using these patterns:

**From Technical Trends:**

**From Content Trends:**

- "Responsive design challenges" ‚Üí "Mobile-first development for Berlin companies"

**From Business Trends:**
- "GDPR compliance" ‚Üí "GDPR implementation guide for business websites"
- "Sustainability focus" ‚Üí "Sustainable web practices for eco-conscious businesses"

Each generated topic receives a priority score based on:

**High Priority Keywords (+10 points each):**
